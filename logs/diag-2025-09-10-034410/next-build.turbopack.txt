./lib/database.types.ts
210:16  Error: The `{}` ("empty object") type allows any non-nullish value, including literals like `0` and `""`.
- If that's what you want, disable this lint rule with an inline comment or configure the 'allowObjectTypes' rule option.
- If you want a type meaning "any object", you probably want `object` instead.
- If you want a type meaning "any value", you probably want `unknown` instead.  @typescript-eslint/no-empty-object-type
